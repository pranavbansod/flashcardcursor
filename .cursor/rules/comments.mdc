# Code Comments Guidelines

## Core Principles

1. **Avoid unnecessary comments** - Code should be self-documenting through clear naming and structure
2. **Only comment complex logic** - Add comments only when the code's intent is not immediately obvious
3. **Remove redundant comments** - If the code is readable, comments are not needed
4. **Prefer clear code over comments** - Refactor code to be more readable rather than adding explanatory comments

## When to Add Comments

- Complex algorithms or business logic that isn't self-evident
- Workarounds for known issues or limitations
- Non-obvious performance optimizations
- Complex type transformations or data manipulations

## When NOT to Add Comments

- Simple variable declarations
- Obvious function names and parameters
- Standard patterns and conventions
- Self-explanatory code blocks
- Type definitions that are clear from context

## Examples

### ❌ Bad - Unnecessary Comment
```typescript
// Get the user ID
const userId = user.id;

// Return the decks
return decks;
```

### ✅ Good - No Comment Needed
```typescript
const userId = user.id;
return decks;
```

### ✅ Good - Complex Logic Comment
```typescript
// Transform nested structure to flat array, preserving order
// while handling circular references
const flattened = transformNestedData(data, visited);
```
